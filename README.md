Usage
===

Download the zip by navigating to my github and clicking the green Clone or download button, followed by Download zip

Extract the contents to C: so they show up like this

C:/PSDK3v3-master/*

Rename PSDK3v3-master to PSDK3v3

Send the MinGW exe file found at C:/PSDK3v3/msys64/mingw64.exe to Desktop as shortcut.

Run the shortcut once as administrator.

That's it! You can now compile the latest projects for vita :)

Enjoy :)
